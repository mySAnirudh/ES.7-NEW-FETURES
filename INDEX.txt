This chapter provides knowledge about the new features in ES7. 
Exponentiation Operator
ES7 introduces a new mathematical operator called exponentiation operator. This operator 
is similar to using Math.pow() method. Exponentiation operator is represented by a double 
asterisk **. The operator can be used only with numeric values. The syntax for using the 
exponentiation operator is given below:
Syntax
The syntax for the exponentiation operator is mentioned below:
base_value ** exponent_value
Example
The following example calculates the exponent of a number using 
the Math.pow() method and the exponentiation operator.
<script>
 let base = 2
 let exponent = 3
 console.log('using Math.pow()',Math.pow(base,exponent))
 console.log('using exponentiation operator',base**exponent)
 
 </script>
The output of the above snippet is as given below:
using Math.pow() 8
using exponentiation operator 8
